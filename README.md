# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub, I'm really inexperienced but willing to learn

Oh my god I'm actually doing it

I'm making something outside my comfort zone out of curiosity
Anyway, I'm Noon and I'm trying to learn stuff so that I can join an RP Group I've always wanted to join

Wish me luck!
